# Software-Engineering-Project
Performed structured analysis and structured design (SA/SD) for the following CASE 
tool for Structured Analysis Software to be developed for automating various 
activities associated with developing a CASE tool for structured software analysis. 
• The case tool should support a graphical interface and the following 
features. 
• The user should be able to draw bubbles, data stores, and entities and 
connect them using data flow arrows. The data flow arrows are annotated 
by the corresponding data names.
• Should support editing the data flow diagram.
• Should be able to create the diagram hierarchically. The user should be 
able to determine balancing errors whenever required. 
• The software should be able to create the data dictionary automatically. 
• Should support printing the diagram on a variety of printers. 
• Should support querying the data items and function names. The 
diagrams matching the query should be shown.
